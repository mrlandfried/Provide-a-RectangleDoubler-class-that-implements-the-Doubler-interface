 

Some objects can be doubled, for example a bank account. The result would be a bank account with twice the balance. 

Some objects can't be doubled. For example, there is no double of a dime coinâ€”no twenty cent coin exists.

The Doubler interface (given) describes a callback that can compute the doubling of a given object.

Your job is to provide a class RectangleDoubler that computes the doubling of a Rectangle. The doubling should have double the width and height, but the same x and y positions of the top left corner.
